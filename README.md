# HierOpt

A MatLab toolbox for the analytical hierarchical computation of scaling and noise parameters. 

Currently, it supports proportionality, offset and noise parameters for normally distributed errors.

## Examples

In the examples, the hierarchical approach is used to perform parameter estimation on Systems Biology ODE models. To compute derivatives of the objective function, both the forward and adjoint approach can be used.
