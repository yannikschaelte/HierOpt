# HierOpt

A MatLab toolbox for the analytical computation of scaling factors.

Currently, it supports proportionality, offset and variance parameters for normally distributed errors.

In the examples, the hierarchical approach is used to perform parameter estimation on Systems Biology ODE models. To compute derivatives of the objective function, both the forward and adjoint approach can be used.
